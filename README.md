# Calendar
Calendar Project using HTML, CSS and Javascript
Calendars are a very useful widget or part of an application, as we can see from the frequency in which we use them ourselves (at least for the forgetful people like me!). In fact they can be so useful that there are currently apps dedicated solely to this function in our smartphones and other gadgets.
So decided to create one using HTML, CSS and Javascript.
Also added the day-night mode function which togles the background color.
